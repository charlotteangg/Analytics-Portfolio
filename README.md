# Project 1: Bike Sharing Case Study
This is a capstone project I did under the Google Analytics Professional Certificate, where I analyzed bike share data to understand how casual users differ from Cyclistic members, therefore informing marketing strategy to get casual users to subscribe as a member.

Note: Hey there! I’m still putting the finishing touches on my portfolio. Check back soon for new projects ✨
